### Project Description: 
This challenge is a simple Android Application with three Activities, the first Activity is the main Activity with two Buttons.
Button 1 takes you to Activity B when clicked.
Button 2 takes you to Activity C when clicked.
Activity B is the About ALC page, it contains only a Webview that loads the URL https://andela.com/alc/ which is the ALC about page.
Activity C is your profile, it contains an ImageView which should display your photo,
TextViews showing your name, Track, Country, Email and Phone Number.

Giving this project a star won't be bad :)

# Personal Comment
I enjoyed working on this project and had a challenge with the webview because the url was returning some SSL error, however, I got it solved thanks to this help: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55120500/3884184
